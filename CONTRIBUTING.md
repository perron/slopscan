# Contributing to slopscan

Thanks for wanting to help. This is a small, original, clean-room CLI. The useful work is tight tests and honest docs, not a larger surface area.

## How to run tests

Python 3.10 or later.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python3 -m pytest -q
```

Please run the test suite before you open a pull request, and add a test for any new behavior.

## Good first issues

These are useful and bounded:

- Accept an optional extra patterns file so a team can add house tells without forking the defaults.
- Walk a directory of `.md` / `.html` / `.css` files and summarize by file.
- Skip fenced code blocks in Markdown so a quoted phrase in an example is not a hit.

If you pick one, open an issue first so two people do not do the same work.

## Pull request guidelines

- Keep the change small and explain why it is needed.
- Do not add a required runtime dependency without a strong reason. This tool has none today.
- Do not copy source from another project. Original code only.
- Do not weaken a safety check to make a test easier.
- Update the README if the user-visible behavior or limits change. Keep the claims honest.
- Do not commit secrets, store files, journals, or `.env` files.

## Reporting a vulnerability

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Do not open a public issue that includes secrets or a live exploit payload.
